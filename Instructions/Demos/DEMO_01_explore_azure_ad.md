## Demo scenario

In this demo, you'll access Microsoft Entra ID and walk through the various settings for an existing user.

1. Open Microsoft Edge.

1. In the address bar, enter **admin.microsoft.com** to access the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. Sign in with your admin credentials.
    1. In the Sign-in window, enter **admin@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) then select **Next**.
    1. Enter the admin password that should be provided by your lab hosting provider. Select **Sign in**.
    1. When prompted to stay signed- in, select **Yes**.

1. From the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Show all**.

1. Under Admin centers, select **Identity** (you may need to scroll down).  A new browser page opens to the overview page of the Microsoft Entra admin center. Here you will see basic information about your Contoso tenant. If you scroll down the main window you will also see information about alerts, my feed, feature highlights, and more.  
    1. Note to presenter/instructor: you can also access the Microsoft Entra Admin center directly by going to **[entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com)**.

1. From the left navigation pane, expand **Users** then select **All users**.  On the users page you can see additional navigation options and the list of users. Your tenant is already configured with users.

1. From the list of users, select **Adele Vance**.

1. Notice that on the left navigation panel, **Overview** is highlighted in light grey.  Show/speak to the information shown on the overview page.  Select the **Monitoring** tab on the top of the page which shows user sign-ins (no sign-in will show, unless you previously signed-in as Adele Vance).  Then Select **Properties** to see all the properties for the Adele Vance user object.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Assigned roles**.  This user doesn't have any administrative roles assigned.  From the top of the page, select **+ Add assignments**, then from the add assignments page, expand the Search role field under Select role to see a listing of the types of administrative roles available.  Do not add any, just close out of the page by selecting the **X** on the top right of the page.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Groups**.  Speak to the fact that this user is a member of several groups.  Here you can speak to the types of groups.  To add this user to other groups, you would select **+ Add memberships**.  Do not add any new groups, just speak to the point of how easy it is to add a user to existing groups. Close out of the Select groups window by selecting the **X** on the top right corner of the page.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Licenses**. Notice that this user is assigned Microsoft 365 E5 licenses and EMS license.  To add a license, select **+ Assignments** from the top of the main window.  Show the licenses for this user. Do NOT change anything.  Close out of this window by selecting the **X** on the top right corner of the page.

1. From the left navigational panel, select **Devices**.  Nothing shows up, but you can say that if this user were to have devices assigned, this is where it would show up.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Azure role assignments**.  Call out:
    1. This is different than the assigned roles tab shown earlier in that that earlier tab is for role-based access control in Microsoft Entra.
    1. Although nothing is listed here, this is the tab where you would be able to view role assignments, assigned to Adele, for Azure resources. For example, if you were to create an Azure Resource Group, and you assign Adele a specific role, such as the owner or contributor for the resource group, you would see that role listed here. This is part of Azure Role Based Access Control (Azure RBAC). That role assignment is added and managed as part of that specific resource.

1. Select the **X** on the top right corner of the page. This returns you to the user list.

1. Select the **X** on the top right corner of the page. This returns you to the main page for the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Keep this browser tab open as you will use it for the next demo.

### Review

In this demo, you showed the settings of an existing user including groups to which the user can be assigned, the availability of roles, and assigning of user licenses.
