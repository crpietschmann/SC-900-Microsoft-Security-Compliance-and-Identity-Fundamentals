    1. **Solutions**. This opens a new panel with all the solutions and related portals.
    1. **Learn** to view links to docs, videos, and blogs.
    1. **Settings**. Explore these options at will. From here you can configure roles and scopes, data connector, and all solution settings.

### Demo Part 2

Learn about your organization’s compliance posture through Compliance Manager.
