# Lab: Explore Privileged Identity management

This lab maps to the following Learn content:

- Learning Path: Describe the capabilities of Microsoft Entra
- Module: Describe the identity protection and governance capabilities of Microsoft Entra
- Unit: Describe the capabilities of Privileged Identity Management

## Lab scenario

In this lab, you'll explore some of the basic functionality of Privileged Identity Management (PIM). PIM does require  Microsoft Entra ID P2 licensing.  In this lab, you, as the admin, will configure one of your users, Diego Siciliani, with a Microsoft Entra user administrator role, through Privileged ID management (PIM).   With user admin privileges, Diego will be able to create users and groups manage licenses, and more.  Both the admin and the user, Diego, must be configured for Microsoft Entra ID P2 licensing.

**Estimated Time**: 60 minutes

### Task 1

In this task you, as the admin, will reset the password for the user Diego Siciliani. This step is needed so you can initially sign in as the user in subsequent tasks.

1. Open Microsoft Edge.  In the address bar, enter **https://entra.microsoft.com**.

1. Sign in with the Microsoft 365 admin credentials provided by your ALH.
    1. In the Sign-in window, enter **admin@WWLxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your ALH) then select **Next**.
    1. Enter the admin password that should be provided by your lab hosting provider. Select **Sign in**.
    1. If you have previously logged in as the admin, you may be prompted to complete a secondary authentication, as part of MFA. IF you haven't previously logged in as the admin, you may be prompted to complete the MFA registration process.Follow the prompts on the screen to setup MFA.
    1. When prompted to stay signed- in, select **Yes**.

1. From the left navigation panel, expand **Identity**, expand **Users**, then select **All users**.

1. Select **Diego Siciliani** from the list of users.

1. Select **Reset password** from the top of the page. Since you haven't previously signed in as Diego, you don’t know his password, and will need to reset the password.

1. When the password reset window opens, select **Reset Password**.  IMPORTANT, make a note of the new password, as you'll need it in a subsequent task, to be able to sign in as the user.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Home** to return the home page for the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. Keep the browser page open, as you'll need it in the subsequent task.

### Task 2

In this task you, as the admin, will assign Diego a Microsoft Entra ID role in Privileged Identity Management.

1. Open the browser tab for the home page of the Microsoft Entra admin center.

1. From the left navigation panel, under "Identity", expand **Identity Governance**, then select **Privileged Identity Management**.

1. You are now in the Privileged Identity Management quick start page. Review the information on the Get started page. In the main window, under where it says Manage access, select **Manage**.

1. You're now in the Setting page.  Leave the Assignment type to the default setting, Eligible.

1. If the Permanently eligible box is checked, select **Permanently eligible**, to remove the checkmark.

1. In the Assignment start fields, keep the default date and time, which is today and the current time.

1. In the Assignment end fields, change the date to today’s date (note the default setting is one year from the today, so you need to change the year).

### Review

In this lab; you, explored PIM.  You, as the admin, configured Diego with user admin privileges for a specified amount of time.  Then you, as Diego, walked through the process of activating the user admin privileges and a user to a group.  Recall that PIM requires Microsoft Entra ID Premium P2 licensing.
